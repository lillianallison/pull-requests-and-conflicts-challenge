# Pull Requests and Conflict Resolution Challenge

Hello!

In order to complete this challenge, you will create a fork of our repository, modify it, and then send us a pull request to review.

There are two branches in this repository: "start-from-here", and "merge-to-here".
"start-from-here" will be the default branch, so it is okay to leave "copy the main branch only" checked when you create your fork.

When you make your changes, please modify both index.html and styles.css, and have a minimum of 6 lines changed.
Make sure you change the image details, the paragraph text, and the background colour. This is so that your pull request will have conflicts!
The rest of the changes are up to you, and you can make as many as you like.
They can be small adjustments such as swapping a letter or changing a hex colour code.

When you are done, you will push your changes to your fork and submit a pull request to our original repository.
Make sure you choose "merge-to-here" as your base branch, and "start-from-here" as your branch to compare.

After submitting your pull request, you can step away for a little bit.

One of us will review your pull request and request a few simple changes. You will then update your pull request with those changes and resolve your conflicts.

Keep in mind that your pull request will not actually be merged. You will receive a point for the challenge after making the changes requested by your reviewer.
